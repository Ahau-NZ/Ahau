## Setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Development

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
Launches electron app, connecting to a dev-server which is compiling and hot-reloading front-end (UI) code.

NOTE live-reload doesn't work for `ssb-server` (back end) code.

## Production

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

Compiles and minifies code (and assets) for production.

TODO: add `electron-builder` which then creates installers
